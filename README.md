# Heading 1 in a new section
We might be able to use this instead of lab reports for the lab exercises. This is a lot easier than writing a report and makes usable documentation, which I personally find more beneficial.

# Example Function Definitions
Since students are going to be required to write their own functions or we will provide them, we need to figure out the best method to document the functions. As of right now, I have no good way to place markdown in a header file and allow it to import directly into GihHub. 
## Math Functions
The following functions will perform blah blah blah. They require the following dependencies.... These are all part of the [Math Library](https://github.com/RU09342/lab-1-intro-to-git-c-and-msp430-Russty32280/tree/master/Lab1/Assignment).

### Add()
This function takes in two integers and will perform the proper operation and then will return the result.
```c
int Math(int num1, int num2, char operator);
```
